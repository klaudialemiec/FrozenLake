# ML engineer test
We hope this task will give you possibility to present your knowledge
in ML area as well as general coding abilities. But, what is even more
important to us is: you have a lot of fun when solving our task!

## The task
Pick one of the environments from OpenAI gym:

CarRacing-v0: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CarRacing-v0/

or

FrozenLake 8x8-v0: https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake8x8-v0/

Could you provide working solution to this problem? Of course, do not
try to use provided solutions for chosen task.

## What is important to us? 
We want to see your ability to create working model for reinforcement
learning task. The very first thing is to create model which can
effectively play and complete the game.

We will also take a look on your coding skills. It is important to us
to see clear and self-describing solution.

Make sure your solution contains README file which allows us to quickly
setup and run your code.

If there are any artifacts (learned models, graphs, logs) related to task
feel free to commit it to repo.
